Another Wet Shabby is a new addition to the Another shabby script typeface family. It allows you to create watercolor-textured and multilayered color images without having to resort to photo-retouch software. 


Its shapes are defined by rough, wide brushstrokes, slightly rounded in corners to mimic the feel of a real handwritten casual script. All characters are texturized for a watercolour (another wet shabby) or a chalk (another raw  shabby) effect.

Another Wet Shabby covers over 40 languages that use the Latin alphabet, with a full range of accents and diacritics. The full family comes in four weights.


Take care: the textured typeface is very processor intensive and should not be used for long text blocks. Previewing in MacOs and Windows may take some time or freeze your system temporarily. Try before buying!
